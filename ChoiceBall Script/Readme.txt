Thanks for trying out Choice Ball!

This is the choice ball script originally used for data collection in Sanders et. al, in conjunction with Kepecs Lab's real-time behavior system.

We have also provided code and instructions for a microcontroller-based USB trackball server that achieves the same purpose as our original MATLAB script, with enhanced temporal precision. The code and hardware setup instructions are available in the "/ChoiceBall System" folder. We recommend that future projects take advantage of this solution, as it provides faster responses to USB polling events than can be realized with any code on a modern non-realtime operating system.

Correspondence should be addressed to sanders@cshl.edu
