Thanks for trying out Choice Ball!

This is the choice ball script originally used for data collection in Sanders et. al 2012, in conjunction with Kepecs Lab's real-time behavior system.

We have also provided code and instructions for a microcontroller-based USB trackball server that achieves the same purpose as our original MATLAB script as a stand-alone system. The code and hardware setup instructions are available in the "/ChoiceBall System" folder. We recommend that future projects take advantage of this solution, as the microcontroller provides faster responses to USB polling events than can be realized with any code on a modern non-realtime operating system.
